### What's it for?

Yeah, it's a "tiny trick" to tell your love in some "geeky" way.

Do laugh at the code as I'm totally amateur ;)

### How to use?

Copy all the files into your Xcode project, then import `RightnowViewController` as your root view.

### What else?

Did I mention there's also a [javascript version](http://chenhui.ch/FRHeartFloat.js.html)?
